# Reproducing the datakit technical report (diversity plots)

These commands generate the data-diversity figures of the **gridfm-datakit technical report** *gridfm-datakit-v1* ([arXiv:2512.14658](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14658)): the entropy spider plots, the feature violin plots, the branch-flow entropy barplot, and the branch-loading histograms.

The scripts stay on the datakit **`genco-paper-repro`** branch (not default `main`). Clone that branch and run every command from the repository root:

```bash
git clone -b genco-paper-repro https://github.com/gridfm/gridfm-datakit.git
cd gridfm-datakit
```

## 1. Install

Python 3.10–3.12.

```bash
pip install -e '.[dev,test]'
pip install seaborn        # used by plot_branch_loading.py; not a package dependency
export PYTHONPATH=$PWD
```

## 2. Get the data

The figures are computed from a snapshot of sampled parquet (~979 MB), published at [`gridfm/reproducibility-datakit-technical-report`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/gridfm/reproducibility-datakit-technical-report). It is public, so no token is needed:

```bash
hf download gridfm/reproducibility-datakit-technical-report \
    --repo-type dataset \
    --exclude "full/*" \
    --local-dir scripts/datakit_report/dataset_sampled
```

`--exclude "full/*"` is what keeps this to ~1 GB — without it you also pull the 15 GB of non-downsampled data described below.

The scripts expect it at `scripts/datakit_report/dataset_sampled/` (the default), or point them elsewhere with `--data-dir`.

The snapshot holds six datasets on `case118_ieee`, each downsampled to exactly 10,000 scenarios × 118 buses so that every library contributes equally to the diversity metrics:

| File prefix | Mode | Library |
|---|---|---|
| `gridfm_datakit_pf` | PF | this library, `mode: pf` |
| `gridfm_datakit_opf` | OPF | this library, `mode: opf` |
| `pfdelta` | PF | PFΔ |
| `opfdata` | OPF | OPFData |
| `pglearn` | OPF | PGLearn |
| `opflearn` | OPF | OPF-Learn |

Each has `_bus_data.parquet` and `_gen_data.parquet`; the two PF datasets also have `_branch_data.parquet` (needed for the branch figures).

### The full, non-downsampled data

The same HuggingFace repo also holds the complete datasets under `full/`, for anyone who needs more than the 10,000 scenarios used by the figures. **You do not need this to reproduce the figures** — it is 15 GB against the snapshot's 1 GB.

    └── pfdelta/               PFΔ                        29,000 scenarios
```

## 3. Generate the figures

```bash
OUT=scripts/datakit_report/out

# Entropy spider plots (PF and OPF)
python scripts/datakit_report/plot_spider.py --mode pf  --metric entropy --output-dir $OUT
python scripts/datakit_report/plot_spider.py --mode opf --metric entropy --output-dir $OUT

# Feature violin plots: Pd, Qd, Pg, Qg, Vm, Va for PF and OPF
python scripts/datakit_report/plot_violin.py --mode pf  --output-dir $OUT
python scripts/datakit_report/plot_violin.py --mode opf --output-dir $OUT

# Branch flow entropy barplot (Pf, Qf)
python scripts/datakit_report/plot_bar_branch.py --metric entropy --output-dir $OUT

# Branch loading histograms
python scripts/datakit_report/plot_branch_loading.py --output-dir $OUT
```

That writes 17 PDFs into `scripts/datakit_report/out/`:

| Script | Output |
|---|---|
| `plot_spider.py` | `spider_plot_entropy_{pf,opf}.pdf` |
| `plot_violin.py` | `{Pd,Qd,Pg,Qg,Vm,Va}_violin_{pf,opf}.pdf` |
| `plot_bar_branch.py` | `barplot_branch_entropy_pf.pdf` |
| `plot_branch_loading.py` | `branch_loading_{datakit,pfdelta}.pdf` |

Every script takes `--output-dir`, `--data-dir`, and `--datasets` (to restrict the comparison to a subset). `plot_spider.py` and `plot_bar_branch.py` also take `--metric std` for the standard-deviation variant; omitting `--metric` produces both.

The first spider or violin run calls `load_net_from_pglib("case118_ieee")`, which downloads the PGLib case into the installed package's `grids/` directory and may resolve the pinned Julia packages. That is a one-off, cached cost — none of these scripts solve OPF or PF.

## What the numbers mean

`plot_branch_loading.py` prints the overload statistics alongside the histograms:

```
Loading gridfm_datakit_pf...
  percentage of overloaded branches per scenario: 1.2158602150537636
  percentage of scenarios with overloaded branches: 79.07
Loading pfdelta...
  percentage of overloaded branches per scenario: 8.027258064516129
  percentage of scenarios with overloaded branches: 100.0
```

Branch loading is `max(S_from, S_to) / rate_a` with `S = sqrt(P² + Q²)`; a branch is overloaded when it exceeds 1.

**Entropy.** `plot_utils.py` implements the mean normalized Shannon entropy: a 100-bin histogram per bus over a fixed domain, entropy in bits, averaged across buses and normalized by `log2(100)`, giving a value in `[0, 1]`. Domains are `(-π, π]` for `Va` (treated as circular via `entropy_circular_from_deg_fixed`), the network voltage bounds for `Vm`, and per-bus empirical min/max **pooled across all compared datasets** for `Pd, Qd, Pg, Qg`. Pooling the domain is what makes the values comparable across libraries instead of reflecting per-dataset binning.

## Rebuilding the snapshot from raw output

Only needed if you are generating new datasets rather than reproducing the published figures.

```bash
python scripts/datakit_report/prepare_datasets.py --base-path /path/to/raw/datasets [--seed 0]
```

It finds the smallest scenario count across the datasets and downsamples all of them to it. The gridfm-datakit inputs themselves are generated with the configs in [`scripts/datakit_report/configs/`](https://github.com/gridfm/gridfm-datakit/tree/genco-paper-repro/scripts/datakit_report/configs) (`gridfm_datakit generate scripts/datakit_report/configs/case118_ieee_pf.yaml`); the full non-downsampled data is on HuggingFace under `full/`. Note that the subset is drawn randomly: a fresh run yields a different sample and therefore slightly different figures. `--seed` makes a run repeatable but cannot recover the published snapshot — use the HuggingFace snapshot for that.

The external libraries must be converted to this repository's parquet schema first:

| Library | Converter |
|---|---|
| PFΔ | `pfdelta/batch_convert_pfdelta.py` |
| OPFData | `opf_data/batch_convert.py` |
| PGLearn | `scripts/datakit_report/pg_learn_conversion.py` (set `PGLEARN_DIR`) |
| OPF-Learn | `scripts/datakit_report/opf_learn_conversion.py` (set `OPFLEARN_DIR`) |

## Notes

- **Bus selection in the violin plots is pinned.** Each violin panel shows 10 buses, fixed in `PINNED_BUSES` in `plot_violin.py` so the figures are stable across runs. Pass `--no-pin` to sample buses randomly instead.
- **`plot_branch_loading.py` forces the `Agg` matplotlib backend** before importing pyplot. On macOS the default `macosx` backend applies Retina scaling to saved vector output, which changes the rendering. Do not reorder those imports.
- **`plot_spider_branch.py` and `plot_violin_branch.py`** produce branch-level spider and violin figures that are not part of the paper. They are kept because they were part of the original analysis. Careful: `plot_spider_branch.py` writes the same filename as `plot_bar_branch.py` (`barplot_branch_{metric}_pf.pdf`), so run them into separate `--output-dir`s.
